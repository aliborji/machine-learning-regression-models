### retail-store-expansion-analysis-with-lasso-and-ridge-regressions

Based on a dataset containing the spirits purchase information of Iowa Class E liquor licensees by product and date of purchase this project provides recommendations on where to open new stores in the state of Iowa. To devise an expansion strategy, I first needed to understand the data and for that I conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA). With the data in hand I built multivariate regression models of total sales by county, using both Lasso and Ridge regularization, and based on these models, I made recommendations about new locations.
