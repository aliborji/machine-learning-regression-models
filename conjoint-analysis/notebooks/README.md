# Conjoint Analysis

A very brief description:
- Conjoint analysis allows researchers to predict consumers' choice shares asking respondents to evaluate product profiles (which include multiple product features) instead of directly asking which attributes they find most relevant.
- The result of the analysis is a set of preference scores (or part-worth utilities) for each level of each attribute.
